# Automated Log Cleaner

## Project Overview
This project automates the cleanup of log files generated by various applications and systems using Python. It helps manage disk space by removing or archiving log files based on user-defined criteria such as file age and size.

## Features
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- **Automated Cleanup**: Deletes or archives log files based on size and age thresholds.
- **Email Notifications**: Sends reports and alerts via email.
- **Scheduled Execution**: Integrates with `cron` (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows) for periodic cleanup.

## How the Solution is Unique
- **Lightweight**: Focuses purely on log file cleanup based on user-defined parameters, making it ideal for small- to medium-sized systems without the overhead of more robust solutions.
- **Highly Customizable**: Users can define specific rules for file deletion (e.g., size and age limits).
- **Cross-Platform**: The script is Python-based and runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows with minimal changes.
- **Reporting & Alerts**: Provides automated reports and can generate email notifications to keep users informed of cleanup actions.
- **Targeted for Small Environments**: While most tools focus on large enterprises, this solution is ideal for individuals, small businesses, or home servers needing simple, customizable log management.

## Differences from Existing Solutions
- **Complexity**: This solution is simple and requires minimal setup, unlike complex enterprise-grade tools like Splunk or Logrotate.
- **Cost**: Free and open-source, unlike many commercial log management solutions.
- **Flexibility**: Python's cross-platform nature offers more flexibility compared to traditional tools.
- **Automation**: Automates the cleanup process with scheduled tasks, unlike manual log cleanup methods.
- **Advanced Features**: Offers automated reports and email notifications, which are absent in most manual solutions.

## Advantages
- **Ease of Use**: Simple configuration and purpose-built for log file cleanup without the complexity of full log management systems.
- **Customizable**: Allows users to tweak deletion rules based on age and size, making it ideal for specialized needs.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on multiple platforms with minimal adjustments.
- **Cost-Effective**: Free and open-source, making it accessible to small teams and personal projects.
- **Automation**: Automates cleanup tasks with schedulers, reducing manual intervention.
- **Transparency**: Provides feedback through reports and email notifications to enhance accountability.

## Disadvantages
- **Narrow Scope**: Focuses on log scrubbing based on file size and age; lacks features like log analysis or indexing.
- **Not Scalable for Large Enterprises**: Not suitable for complex log management in large enterprises.
- **No Real-Time Monitoring**: Does not offer real-time log monitoring or alerting.
- **Manual Scheduler Configuration**: Requires users to manually configure cron jobs or Task Scheduler tasks.

## Sustainability
- **Low Resource Usage**: Lightweight and efficient, making it a sustainable choice for optimizing system performance.
- **Flexible**: Easy to modify and extend for future needs.
- **Environment-Specific**: Ideal for home servers or small businesses, avoiding the bloat of large enterprise software.
- **Easy Maintenance**: Simple Python script, easy to update and maintain without overhauling the system.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Omkarharkulkar/automated-log-cleaner.git
    cd automated-log-cleaner
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install smtplib
    ```

## Usage
1. Configure the log cleaner:
    - Set directory path, file age, and file size in the configuration file (`config.json`).

2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python log_cleaner.py
    ```

3. Schedule automated cleanups (optional):
    - **Linux**: Add to `cron`.
    - **Windows**: Use Task Scheduler.

## Files
